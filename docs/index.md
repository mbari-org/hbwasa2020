# Abstract

Song is a prevalent behavior in humpback whale populations, even in regions that
are considered to be foraging habitat such as the Monterey Bay National Marine
Sanctuary in the Northeast Pacific, where song is detected nine months out of the year.
In this work we explore various machine learning
methods to classify song units, as a basis for studying song structure and its changes.
We report on a number of analyses and classification exercises based on linear
predictive coding, vector quantization, and machine learning classifiers including
Naive Bayes, first-order Markov chain, and Hidden Markov modeling.
As a baseline for comparison purposes, the distortion measure used to create the codebooks for
vector quantization is itself also used as a means for classification.
With classification accuracy ranging from 88% to 94% across the selected methods 
on a 4.5 hour recording involving 4539 unit occurrences over 8 different unit types,
we evaluate the effect of several signal processing, clustering, and learning parameters
on classification performance with the goal of laying a foundation that can be used to
characterize song vocalization at not only the unit level but also
below (subunit) and above (phrase, theme, song).
